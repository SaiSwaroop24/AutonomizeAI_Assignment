### **Backend (Express + MongoDB):**

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose.
   - Defines a `User` schema with fields: `username`, `details`, `friends`, and a `isDeleted` flag for soft deletes.

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - **Create User:** Saves GitHub user details by fetching from GitHub API if not already in the database.
   - **Get Mutual Followers:** Fetches and stores mutual followers for a GitHub user.
   - **Search Users:** Searches users by `username` or `location` stored in `details`.
   - **Soft Delete User:** Sets `isDeleted` to `true` for soft deletion.
   - **Update User Details:** Updates a user's details field.
   - **List Users Sorted:** Retrieves all non-deleted users sorted by a specified field in the `details`.

3. **Key Features:**
   - Proper error handling.
   - Efficient user search and filtering using MongoDB queries.
   - Handles GitHub API responses gracefully.

### **Frontend (React):**

1. **Components:**
   - **`App`:** Main application for exploring GitHub users.
     - Allows searching for users, displaying repositories, and mutual followers.
     - Fetches GitHub user data and updates the database.
   - **`DatabaseManager`:** Manages user data stored in the database.
     - Provides search, soft delete, update, and sort functionalities.

2. **State Management:**
   - `useState` is used for handling user input, fetched data, and current state (e.g., `repositories`, `followers`).

3. **Key Features:**
   - Dynamic rendering of repositories and followers.
   - Search and sort functionalities for user management.
   - Soft delete and update functionalities for managing users.

4. **Styling:**
   - Basic inline styles for layout and component separation.

### **Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Backend:**
   - **Rate Limiting:** Add rate-limiting for GitHub API requests to avoid hitting API limits.
   - **Validation:** Validate input for endpoints to ensure consistent and secure data handling.
   - **Pagination:** Implement pagination for endpoints like `/api/users` to handle large datasets efficiently.

2. **Frontend:**
   - **Loading States:** Add loading indicators while fetching data from APIs.
   - **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages in case of failures.
   - **State Management Library:** For complex applications, consider a state management library like Redux.

3. **General:**
   - **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like the MongoDB URI in an `.env` file.
   - **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
   - **API Documentation:** Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document and test your API endpoints.
